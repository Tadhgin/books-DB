5. Define your database schema using Sequelize models. Here is an example:

   ```javascript
   const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
   
   class Book extends Model {}
   
   Book.init({
     title: DataTypes.STRING,
     author: DataTypes.STRING,
     ISBN: DataTypes.STRING
   }, {
     sequelize,
     modelName: 'book'
   });
   ```

   This defines a new Sequelize model called "Book" with three fields: title, author, and ISBN. You can define as many models as you need for your database schema.
