4. Create a new Sequelize instance in your code, and connect it to your MySQL database using the Sequelize constructor:

   ```javascript
   const Sequelize = require('sequelize');
   const sequelize = new Sequelize('database_name', 'user_name', 'password', {
     host: 'localhost',
     dialect: 'mysql'
   });
   ```

   Replace 'database_name', 'user_name' and 'password' with the actual values for your MySQL database.

5. Define your database schema using Sequelize models. Here is an example:

   ```javascript
   const { Model, DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
   
   class Book extends Model {}
   
   Book.init({
     title: DataTypes.STRING,
     author: DataTypes.STRING,
     ISBN: DataTypes.STRING
   }, {
     sequelize,
     modelName: 'book'
   });
   ```

   This defines a new Sequelize model called "Book" with three fields: title, author, and ISBN. You can define as many models as you need for your database schema.

6. Use the Sequelize API to interact with your database. Here are some examples:

   ```javascript
   // create a new book record in the database
   await Book.create({
     title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird',
     author: 'Harper Lee',
     ISBN: '9780446310789'
   });
   
   // find all books in the database
   const books = await Book.findAll();
   
   // find a book by its ISBN
   const book = await Book.findOne({
     where: {
       ISBN: '9780446310789'
     }
   });
   
   // update a book record
   book.title = 'Go Set a Watchman';
   await book.save();
   
   // delete a book record
   await book.destroy();
   ```

   This is just a small sample of what you can do with Sequelize. Check out the Sequelize documentation for more information: https://sequelize.org/master/
